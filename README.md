In finance, information is everything, today it is possible to obtain detailed information on the vast majority of financial products available in the markets in a quick and automated way, however, in cases such as Colombia this is not entirely true.

Shares listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC) update their relevant information (closing price, volume, trading time, etc.) every 15 minutes, however, it is impossible to obtain this information automatically. Every time you want to update your database with the latest information you must wait until the end of the trading day to manually download an excel.

Here is a simple way to automate this process and create a database with the relevant intra-day stock information using Python. This program collects detailed information, which is impossible to obtain in the way offered by the BVC, and stores it in a database available for immediate use.
